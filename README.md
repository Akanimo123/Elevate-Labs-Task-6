# Elevate-Labs-Task-6

The objective of this task was to use a database management system (e.e MySQL, PostgreSQL,SQLite etc.) to analyze sales trend and aggregations. The expenses.sql file contains the various SQL scripts contained in the screenshots attached to this repository. To complete this task, I created a table containing product items, product ID and the expense amount. I then wrote SQL scripts to extract values and also sort the results.
